# Tim Dwyer-portfolio
This is my portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU.

# About me
My name is Tim Dwyer. I am a part time Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) student majoring in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (BIDA) at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. I graduated from Penn State in 2013 with a degree in Mathematics. Directly after graduation, I joined PNC as an analyst, and have worked at PNC for the past 6 years. Currently, I am a Business Analytics Senior Manager in Retail Lending. Once I graduate with my masters, I plan on leveraging the skills I have learned at PNC to solve problems more effecient and creatively.

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I hope to learn how to create better data visualizations. Often at work, my team creates presentations with data graphs, tables, and charts that are communicated to multiple levels of the organization. I find it difficult to leverage one presentation to explain a single story to different audiences. I am hopeful that this course will help me tell these stories better. I am also excited to learn new programs and tools to create data visualizations.

## Data Visualization Critique #2

For the second critique assignement in this class, I decided to evaluate a visualization on blockchain usecases in the financial institution sector. This is an area of interest for me since I work for a bank and have studied blockchain in a class at CMU. I found the graph easy to read and understand. However, I thought it would have been improved by adding horizontal gridlines, having the bars be the same color, and having the percents add to 100% instead of 200%. In the graph below, I decided to use the same data, but leverage a donut graph instead of a bar graph. I thought it would better represent the percent results. I also divided all of the data by two to make the graph a bit easier to interpret, and changed the title and chart description to be shorter and more direct. I believe these changes improve the interpretation of data.

Source of the original article and data for all visualizations: "Management Alert – DHS Needs to Address Dangerous Overcrowding and Prolonged Detention of Children and Adults in the Rio Grande Valley (Redacted) ." Office of Inspector General, July 2, 2019. https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Mga/2019/oig-19-51-jul19.pdf


For this assignment, I decided to create 2 graphs for each section. For the analyst report, my audience was senior leaders in the Department of Homeland Security. These individuals will leverage these charts to understand the problem and what is causing the over crowding. Therefore, I wanted to concentrate on the increased demand the border patrol and the ICE being over capacity. The combination of these two factors is over taxing the resources of the border partrol with no improvement in sight. The first chart shows the increase in apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley border patrol. It shows a drastic increase in Children, Adults, and Families. I choose this graph because it shows the leadership team the large amount of increases, which they were not prepared or budgetted for. I choose simple colors that stood out from each other to differentiate the three groups. The second visualization is a bar chart comparing the ICE's funded beds and occupied beds, which will show leadership that the current situation is out of the border controls hands. They need the leadership to not only help improve the situation for both organization to alleiviate the problems.


For the journalists section of the assignment, my audience was for a national news outlet, such as the readers of CNN. Hence, I wanted to use with charts that would result in a more emotional reaction to draw readers to read the story. I choose two pie charts that concentrate on the increased length of stay for the detainees of the border patrol facilities. The first pie chart shows the results for all of the detainees with three categories (less than 3 days, between 3 and 10 days, greater than 10 days). The standard for holding a person is three days, so I choose this to be green. I decided to make between 3 and 10 days to be red since it aligns better with the negative part of the second pie chart and I wanted to keep the colors consistent. I used blue for the final part of the pie since it was different enough from the other 2 slices to differentiate itself. The second pie chart shows the length of time children are being detained in two categories (less than 3 days and greater than 3 days). The color decisions were similar to the first pie chart with the green being the part of the pie that is within the standards and the second is red since they are out of the standards.



The differences between the 2 sections of the assignment are based on the different audiences. As an analyst, I wanted to concentrate on the facts and the root causes of the problems. I achieved this through showing the increase in the apprehensions of the border control and the ICE occupied beds being greater than the funded beds. As a journalist, I wanted to pull in the more emotional facts by concentrating on the high number of people and childred being held outside the regular goals for the border control.
