This is my portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU

# About me
My name is Tim Dwyer. I am a part time Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) student majoring in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (BIDA) at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. I am a business analytics manager in Retail Lending at PNC Bank. Once I graduate, I plan on leveraging the skills I have learned at PNC.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to create data visualizations, which are easy to understand multiple different audiences leveraging new programs and tools. I also hope to learn the best practices for good data visualizations and how to combine many complex visualizations to tell one unified story.
