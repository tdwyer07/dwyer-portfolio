This is my portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU.

# About me
My name is Tim Dwyer. I am a part time Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) student majoring in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (BIDA) at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. I graduated from Penn State in 2013 with a degree in Mathematics. Directly after graduation, I joined PNC as an analyst, and have worked at PNC for the past 6 years. Currently, I am a Business Analytics Senior Manager in Retail Lending. Once I graduate with my masters, I plan on leveraging the skills I have learned at PNC to solve problems more effecient and creatively.

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I hope to learn how to create better data visualizations. Often at work, my team creates presentations with data graphs, tables, and charts that are communicated to multiple levels of the organization. I find it difficult to leverage one presentation to explain a single story to different audiences. I am hopeful that this course will help me tell these stories better. I am also excited to learn new programs and tools to create data visualizations.

## Data Visualization Critique #2

For the second critique assignement in this class, I decided to evaluate a visualization on blockchain usecases in the financial institution sector. This is an area of interest for me since I work for a bank and have studied blockchain in a class at CMU. I found the graph easy to read and understand. However, I thought it would have been improved by adding horizontal gridlines, having the bars be the same color, and having the percents add to 100% instead of 200%. In the graph below, I decided to use the same data, but leverage a donut graph instead of a bar graph. I thought it would better represent the percent results. I also divided all of the data by two to make the graph a bit easier to interpret, and changed the title and chart description to be shorter and more direct. I believe these changes improve the interpretation of data.
